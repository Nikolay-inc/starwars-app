## Getting Started

Clone the Repository:

1. Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
cd starwars-app
npm install
```

3. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. Run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the Next.js development server.
You can access your project at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Running Tests

4. Run Jest to execute unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

5. If you want to continuously watch for changes and re-run tests, you can use:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Additional Information

6. If you want to build your project for production deployment, you can use:

```bash
npm run build
```

7. After building the project, you can start the production server using:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the Next.js server in production mode.

By following these steps, you can set up your project locally and run tests to ensure everything is working as expected
